## Arrays:
Arrays let us keep multiple values together in a single collection.
##### EX.
```javascript
let arr= ["abd","khaled"];
```
#### like Strings, Arrays have a length, and each value has an index:
##### EX.
```javascript
let arr= ["abd","khaled"];
arr[1];// the output is "khaled"
arr.length // the output is 2
arr.indexOf("abd") // The output is 0
```
---
#### also like strings, we can check if an array contains a certain vale

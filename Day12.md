## Philosophy of Coercion:

You don't deal with these type conversion corner cases by avoiding coercions. 

Instead, you have to adopt a coding style that makes value types plain and obvious

A quality JS program embraces coercions, making sure the types involved in every operation are clear. Thus, corner cases are safely managed. 

JavaScript's dynamic typing isnot a weakness, it's one of itsstrong qualities
